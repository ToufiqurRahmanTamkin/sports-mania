# Sports Mania

Sports Mania is a simple react application wherein there are so many sports club teams on the home page. There are some important data for a specific club in the API, and one can get the team details by clicking on the explore button. There is a new route in the explore button, which shows the team details with all dynamic details according to the API. Club banner and types, and other details are shown on the details page, coming from the API.
This application is responsible for both the computer screen and mobile screen.

This application is developed by me using react routing, font awesome, and react-bootstrap.
