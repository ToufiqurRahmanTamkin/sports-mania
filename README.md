# Sports Mania

Sports mania is a simple react application where in the home page there are so many sports club teams. In the API there is some important data for specific club and one can get the team details by clicking on the explore button. In the explore button there is a new route and that shows the team details with all dynamic details according to the API. Club banner and types and other details are shown in the details page which is coming from the API.
This application is responsive for both computer screen and mobile screen.

This application is developed by me using react routing, fontawesome and react bootstrap.
